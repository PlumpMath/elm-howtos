==========

How-tos for the Elm language.

These are sets of HTML pages and (where appropriate) sample programs, to be added to as I find things worth explaining.

To use: Clone the repository and open the HTML page you want to read in your favorite browser.

For now, the only howto is "How to install in Ubuntu."
